    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a delicious French pastry, known by its crescent shape.
      (Croissant means crescent in French). Puff pastry is used to make this
      delicacy - the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded a few
      times, then rolled into its shape. It is then glazed with butter and
      baked. It is perfect served warm with some strawberry jam on the side.
    </p>
    <h3>Five fun facts:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The original croissant was called Kipfel and originated in Austria in
        1683. It was created in honor of the Austrian victory over the Turks and
        modeled after the crescent on the Turkish flag. (Some historians say the
        croissant originated in Hungary)
      </li>
      <li>
        August Zang, an Austrian artillery officer, is credited with bringing
        the croissant to France when he opened his own Viennese bakery in Paris.
        (Some say it was Marie Antoinette who brought the croissant to
        France...)
      </li>
      <li>The Croissant became the French national product in 1920.</li>
      <li>
        The Croissant started as a luxury product, but by the end of the
        nineteenth century, it was middle-class (the rich preferred a good
        brioche).
      </li>
      <li>
        Before the modern croissant, puff pastry was used as a garnish or shell,
        not to eat on its own.
      </li>
    </ol>
